# COVID-19 Data Exploration Project 

## Overview 

This repository contains SQL queries and scripts for exploring COVID-19 data, including cases, deaths, vaccinations, and population statistics. The project uses SQL Server to query the data. The data is sourced from the PortfolioProject database.

## Skills Demonstrated

- SQL querying
- Data manipulation using SQL
- Working with temporary tables, CTEs (Common Table Expressions), and views
- Calculations involving windows functions and aggregate functions

## Project Structure

- `covid_data_queries.sql`: Contains SQL queries for data exploration.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Data Sources

- `CovidDeaths`: Contains COVID-19 cases, deaths, and population data.
- `CovidVaccinations`: Contains COVID-19 vaccination data.

## Usage

1. **Prerequisites**: You need access to a SQL Server instance and the PortfolioProject database.

2. **Running the Queries**: Open the `covid_data_queries.sql` file in your preferred SQL client and connect to your SQL Server instance.

3. **Executing Queries**: Execute the SQL queries one by one to explore different aspects of the COVID-19 data. Please note that some queries may take time to complete, depending on the size of the dataset.

4. **View**: The project includes a view named `PercentPopulationVaccinated` that can be used to retrieve and visualize data about the percentage of the population that has received COVID-19 vaccinations.

5. **Visualization**: You can use the data generated by the queries for further analysis, visualization, or reporting.

## Data Exploration Highlights

- **Total Cases vs Total Deaths**: Shows the likelihood of dying if contracting COVID-19 in your country.
- **Total Cases vs Population**: Shows what percentage of the population has been infected with COVID-19.
- **Countries with Highest Infection Rate Compared to Population**: Lists countries with the highest infection rates.
- **Countries with Highest Death Count per Population**: Lists countries with the highest death counts per population.
- **Continent-level Data Exploration**: Includes continent-level data analysis.
- **Global Numbers**: Displays global statistics for new cases, total cases, total deaths, and death percentage.
- **Population vs Vaccinations**: Analyzes the percentage of the population that has received at least one COVID-19 vaccine.

## Data Visualization

You can use the data and insights obtained from this project to create data visualizations, reports, or dashboards for better data understanding and presentation.
